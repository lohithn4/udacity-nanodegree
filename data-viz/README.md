# Summary
This chart shows how NBA Hall of Fame players and the 2016 NBA All-Stars have
progressed over their careers. It shows all-time leaders in each statistical
category. The chart shows which 2016 All-Stars are on pace to become all-time
leaders and/or future Hall of Famers.

# Design 
Initial design:

- I wanted to show how the all-stars have progressed over the years in comparison
to the Hall of Famers so I changed their color so they would stick out. Now you can
distinguish which active players could go on to become future Hall of Famers.

- In a straight on viewing of the chart, the line plots were clustered around years
1-5. Some of the all-stars have only been in the NBA for five years. I changed the
perspective so that every player can be singled out and compared to the rest of the
plotted lines.

- In the perspective view, the vertical axis was placed in the back of the chart so the
statistical leaders set the baseline viewing of line plots. The 20-year careers set the
bar and the other players can be compared to it.

- Animation was added to the changing of the different viewing selections to make it
obvious the data being view was changing and the change was taking effect.

- Highlighting was added to a selected player to distinguish its plot from the rest of the chart.
